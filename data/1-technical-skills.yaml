        - You provide technical advice and weighs in on technical decisions that impact other teams or the company at large. You research and propose new technologies.
        - You are sought out for technical guidance; you anticipate technical issues at the product level and make architectural and design decisions to avoid them.

    - summary: You build complex, business-critical systems used widely within the organization
      signals:
        - You own and are an expert on entire products or on large sections of our codebase. 
        - You are capable of debugging the hairiest problems that the team encounters.
        - You are able to recognize and make trade-offs with respect to the whole system. 
        - You understand deeply the entire architecture for a major part of our business and are able to articulate clearly the scaling and reliability limits of that area.
